# GCP Services Overview

One of the hardest things to learn when starting out with GCP is the array of products offered. This page gives you a summary of the services. Just to get you started.

Under each service summary you will find a `🤔 Think of` point. You may also find a `🌏 Scope` or `🗺️ Related` or both points. Use these points as a quick reminder of the service function, its scope (Availability Zone, Region, or Global), and related technologies.

For a more complete coverage of the GCP products available, checkout the [Products & Services](https://cloud.google.com/products/) documentation.

## Data Analytics

### Cloud Pub/Sub

[Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/) brings the flexibility and reliability of enterprise message-oriented middleware to the cloud. At the same time, Cloud Pub/Sub is a scalable, durable event ingestion and delivery system that serves as a foundation for modern stream analytics pipelines. By providing many-to-many, asynchronous messaging that decouples senders and receivers, it allows for secure and highly available communication among independently written applications. Cloud Pub/Sub delivers low-latency, durable messaging that helps developers quickly integrate systems hosted on the Google Cloud Platform and externally.

🤔 Think of Pub/Sub as event message passing from one application microservice to the next.
