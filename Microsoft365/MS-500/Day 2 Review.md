**Threat Landscape** – Threat vectors  
**Kill Chain**  
**Phishing etc.**   
**Security Principles**  
SROI  
**Shared responsibility**  
**Exchange Online Protection** -Is a cloud-based email filtering service that helps protect your organization against spam and malware  

**Cloud App Security** – Covered in more detail later in the course is a Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB). Discover and control the use of Shadow IT. Assess their risk levels and business readiness of >16,000 apps against >70 risk. Protect against cyberthreats and anomalies  
Connectors to other cloud services   

**Microsoft Defender for Identity** – formally Azure Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) is a cloud-based security solution that leverages your on-premises Active Directory signals to identify, detect, and investigate advanced threats, compromised identities, and malicious insider actions directed at your organization   
	Portal - cloud based but works with On Prem AD  
	Sensor – on DC Traffic, event, Radius, VPN data  

**Defender for Office 365** – formally Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection helps protect against unknown, sophisticated attacks hidden in email attachments and links, and it provides cutting-edge defenses against zero-day threats, ransomware, and other advanced malware.  
			Safe Links

**Azure Advanced Threat Protection**  
**Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** (used to be Microsoft Defender ATP) combination of technology built into Windows 10 and Microsoft's robust cloud service:
Endpoint behavioral sensors: Embedded in Windows 10, that collect and process behavioral signals from the O/S and sends this sensor data to your private, isolated, cloud instance of Microsoft Defender ATP

**Cloud security analytics:** Leveraging big-data, machine-learning, across the Windows ecosystem, enterprise cloud products (such as Office 365), and online assets, behavioral signals are translated into insights, detections, and recommended responses to advanced threats.  

**Threat Intelligence** Generated by Microsoft augmented by threat intelligence provided by partners, it enables Microsoft Defender ATP to identify attacker tools, techniques, and procedures, and generate alerts when these are observed in collected sensor data, also supplies data specific to you.  

**Security Dashboard** several widgets, such as Threat Management Summary, Threat Protection Status, Global Weekly Threat Detections, Malware, and more.
