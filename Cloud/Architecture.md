## Microservices

The modern microservices application architecture structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services.

### Microservice Technologies

Microservices can be hosted on either or all of the following cloud technologies:

* PaaS - [Platform as a Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service).
* FaaS - [Function as a Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_as_a_service) (also called Serverless).
* Containers based on Kubernetes or other container hosting services.
* Virtual Machine Instances.

### Frameworks and Products of Interest

* [serverless](https://serverless.com/framework/) - The easy, open way to build Serverless applications with Node.js. 
* [Istio](https://istio.io/) - An open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices.
* [Knative](https://github.com/knative/) - Kubernetes-based platform to build, deploy, and manage modern serverless workloads.
