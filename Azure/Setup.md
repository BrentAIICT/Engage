1. **DO NOT USE YOUR EXISTING MICROSOFT ACCOUNTS.**
1. Open [Outlook.com](https://outlook.live.com/owa/).
1. Create a new `Outlook.com` account. For Example, use your last name with the date eg: lastname20180618@outlook.com

## Azure Account ‚öø

To create an Azure subscription you need to prove you are a person and an adult. This is done with a credit card. If you have been supplied with an Azure Pass you can avoid the need to use a credit card:

1. Use your new `outlook.com` email address in the following steps.
1. DO NOT USE YOUR EXISTING MICROSOFT ACCOUNTS.
1. Use one of the following to create a free Azure account (If you are on an Azure course use the [Azure Pass](https://www.microsoftazurepass.com/) option):
   * Azure Pass: https://www.microsoftazurepass.com/ **Use this option for Azure Class**
   * Trial Account (Credit Card Required): https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/ 
1. Follow the steps to create your Azure account.
  - Click START on the webpage

## Bookmarks

Add the following bookmarks to your browser:

* [Skillpipe](https://skillpipe.com)
* [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
* [Microsoft Learning on GitHub](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning)
* [Engage Azure Repository](/Azure)

## Classroom Machine Setup (Optional)

The following is specific to the DDLS classroom machines to add useful software packages for working with Azure. Most of the labs commands are run inside [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/), however you can run them locally with these software packages.

1. Upgrade VSCode:
   * Open VSCode from the start menu (search for `code`).
   * Go to the `Help` menu and then `Check For Updates`.
1. Upgrade Scoop:
   * Open PowerShell.
   * Run the following command: `scoop update`
   * If Scoop is not installed: `iwr -useb get.scoop.sh | iex`
1. Run the following script:

```powershell
scoop bucket add extras
scoop bucket add versions
scoop install pwsh
```

4. Open PowerShell Core from the start menu.
   * _Note: the reason we are using PowerShell Core is because it does not need the latest .NET Framework installed to use the Azure AZ PowerShell module._
5. Run the following script:

```powershell
scoop install 7zip copyq coreutils grep nmap openssh vim wget wireshark docker docker-compose git nodejs jq azure-cli storageexplorer
install-module az -force
```
