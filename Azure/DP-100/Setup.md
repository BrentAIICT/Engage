## Modern Browser

Recommended: [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) ([why use Firefox?](/Internet/Firefox.md))

Some useful extensions:

* [Tree Style Tab (Firefox Only)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/) - Show tabs like a tree.
* [uBlock Origin](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ublock+origin) - Finally, an efficient blocker. Easy on CPU and memory.
* [Imagus](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=imagus) - Enlarge thumbnails, and show images/videos from links with a mouse hover.
* [Octotree](https://www.octotree.io/) - Add-on to display GitHub code in tree format.

## Courseware

1. Go to [Skillpipe](https://skillpipe.com/).
1. Use your personal email address. Not a work email.
1. Register or login with your account.
1. Select `Add a Course` and use the code given to you by the instructor.

## Email Address ðŸ“§

1. Create a throw away email for use in Azure if you wish.
