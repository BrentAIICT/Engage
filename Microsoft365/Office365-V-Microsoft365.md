# Differences between Office 365 and Microsoft 365
The __MS-100 / MS-101__ these aren’t just new Office 365 courses they concentrate more on MDM and Identity Protection / Threat Management which you do not get with Office 365 subscriptions.  Just to clarify the differences see below
## Office 365
Is a cloud-based suite of apps and services centered around business productivity.  Depending on the plan you purchase, subscriptions include robust productivity, collaboration, and security features like:
* Exchange
* Skype for Business
* SharePoint
* OneDrive
* Teams
* Yammer
*Planner

Office 365 has a variety of plans on a per-user per-month subscription. Prices start from $5/user/month and plans can be mixed & matched within your business.  You can also change plans at any time.
## Microsoft 365
* Microsoft 365 is a bundle of services that includes __Office 365.__  but it also includes __Windows 10 Enterprise, Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS)__, and __machine learning.
* Like Office 365, there are multiple plans to choose from depending on your needs with prices staring from $20/user/month. 
* The services included in Microsoft 365 are also available as separate licenses. If you can’t find a plan that fits your needs, you can still achieve close to the same results by buying licenses for all the components (though you may miss out on some of the machine learning benefits).
