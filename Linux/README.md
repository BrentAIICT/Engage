# Linux Reference

## How To Start

You need to create a USB bootable disk. I suggest using [rufus](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus) if you are using Windows.

Before choosing a distribution (the OS to install), decide on the type of desktop you would like to use. The most common desktops are:

* [Gnome](https://www.gnome.org/) - Most popular however different to Windows.
* [XFCE](https://www.xfce.org/) - Similar to Windows. Light weight for low-end devices.
* [Cinnamon](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=cinnamon+linux+desktop) - Managed by Linux Mint. Similar to Windows.
* [MATE](https://mate-desktop.org/) - A fork of Gnome and similar to Windows.

Choose a beginner distribution such as:

* [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/)
  * Base: Ubuntu or Debian
  * Desktop: Cinnamon, MATE, XFCE
  * Easy to install and use.
* [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)
  * Base: Debian
  * Desktop: Gnome, Unity
  * Popular client and server OS.
* [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/)
  * Base: Arch
  * Desktop:  Awesome, bspwm, Budgie, Cinnamon, Deepin, GNOME, i3, KDE Plasma, LXQt, MATE, Openbox, Xfce
  * Good replacement for Windows.
* [MX Linux](https://mxlinux.org/)
  * Base: Deiban 
* [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)
  * Base: Debian is the root of many other distributions. It is the base.
  * Desktop: AfterStep, Awesome, Blackbox, Cinnamon, Fluxbox, flwm, FVWM, GNOME, i3, IceWM, ion, JWM, KDE, LXDE, LXQt, MATE, Openbox, pekwm, Ratpoison, WMaker, XBMC, Xfce
  * This is the default server OS for Google Cloud Platform. It is slightly harder to manage.

Download the ISO files for your chosen distribution and create a bootable USB drive.

Boot to the USB drive and follow the steps provided.
