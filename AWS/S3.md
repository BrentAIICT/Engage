# Amazon S3

## Bucket and Object Access Control

There are [four mechanisms](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/) for controlling access to Amazon S3 resources:

* IAM Policies
* Bucket Policies
* ACLs
* Query String Authentication

These four mechanisms fall under one of [three categories](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-access-control.html):

* User Policies
* Resource-based Policies
* REST API

For a summary of when to use Resource-based policies or User policies, see the [this blog article](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/iam-policies-and-bucket-policies-and-acls-oh-my-controlling-access-to-s3-resources/).

### User Policies

User policies are access policies you attach to IAM Users in your AWS account.

[Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html) are configured using a User Policy assigned to the IAM user or group.

### Resource-based Policies

Resource-based policies are access policies you attach to your resources (buckets and objects).

There are two types of Resource-based policies:

* [Bucket policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-bucket-policies.html) configured on the [S3 Bucket Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/add-bucket-policy.html).
* [Access Control Lists (ACLs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html) which were created prior to IAM policies and is configured through the [S3 Bucket ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/set-bucket-permissions.html) .

### REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface)

With [Query String Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html), you can create a URL to an Amazon S3 object which is only valid for a limited time.

You will find the Query String Authentication access control mechanism mainly used by software packages.
