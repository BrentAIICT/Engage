# Amazon S3

## Security

There are four mechanisms for controlling access to Amazon S3 resources.

These methods can be a little confusing. Take a look at the blog article [IAM Policies and Bucket Policies and ACLs! Oh, My! (Controlling Access to S3 Resources)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/iam-policies-and-bucket-policies-and-acls-oh-my-controlling-access-to-s3-resources/) for a good summary.


These four mechanisms fall under one of three categories:

* Resource-based Policies
* User Policies
* REST API

### Resource-based Policies

Resource-based policies are access policies you attach to your resources (buckets and objects).

There are two types of Resource-based policies:

* Bucket policies (also called [Resource-based policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html)) configured on the [S3 Bucket Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/add-bucket-policy.html).
* [Access Control Lists (ACLs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html) configured through the [S3 Bucket ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/set-bucket-permissions.html) .

### User Policies

User policies are access policies you attach to IAM Users in your AWS account.

* [Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html) configured using a User Policy assigned to the IAM user or group.

### REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface)

With [Query String Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html), you can create a URL to an Amazon S3 object which is only valid for a limited time.
