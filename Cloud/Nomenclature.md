# Cloud Nomenclature or Naming Convention / Standard

> [Nomenclature](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nomenclature?pronunciation&lang=en_us&dir=n&file=nomenc03): a system or set of terms or symbols especially in a particular science, discipline, or art. Nomenclature comes from the Latin nomenclatura, meaning "the assigning of names".

This document can be used to help you design a naming standard or nomenclature for cloud based resources such as virtual machine instances or messaging queues.

Whatever you decide to do, the most important thing to keep in mind when naming resources in the cloud is to maintain a consistent naming convention.
