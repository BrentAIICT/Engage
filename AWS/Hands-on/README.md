# AWS Hands-on Labs and Exercises

Find in this directory extra hands-on you can do to expand your knowledge of AWS.

## Authoring Rules

If you wish to create new demonstrations please name your files following this naming standard:

* All lowercase names.
* Use kebab case (hyphens instead of spaces).
* Use descriptive names.

`[Name of service being demonstrated]-[Name of one or more sub service or feature]-[descriptive name].md`

Example:

`iam-role-ec2-to-s3.md`

For the lab content, keep the steps at a high level. Do not go into detail on where to click. Just supply enough detail so anyone with knowledge of AWS can complete the steps. This will keep maintenance to a minimum.

See the [iam-role-ec2-to-s3](iam-role-ec2-to-s3.md) demonstration as an example or template.

## API Gateway

* [API Gateway + Vue JS + Express + PostgreSQL](https://github.com/allanchua101/api-gateway-vue-express-pg) - Showcases an API gateway using Vue JS, Express, and PostgreSQL on containers.
