* [Google Says It Isn't Killing Ad Blockers. Ad Blockers Disagree](https://www.wired.com/story/google-chrome-ad-blockers-extensions-api/)
* [Browser Market Share Worldwide](https://gs.statcounter.com/) [Browser Market Share (1996-2019) Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=es9DNe0l0Qo) - Chrome is becoming the new IE (control).

Some useful extensions:
