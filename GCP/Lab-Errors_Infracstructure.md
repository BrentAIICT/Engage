# Architecting with Google Cloud Platform: Infrastructure

**Lab Errors**

**Lab 1**

The Cloud Shell now has 6 icons on the far right - but you might have to minimise the menu on the left to see them.

They are (from left to right):
*  Launch Code Editor (beta)
*  Web Preview
*  More settings (the 3 dots)
*  Hide
*  Open in New Window
*  Close all tabs
