# Amazon S3

## Security

There are four mechanisms for controlling access to Amazon S3 resources:

* Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies configured using a User Policy assigned to the IAM user or group.
* Bucket policies (also called [Resource-based policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html)) configured on the [S3 Bucket Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/add-bucket-policy.html).
* Access Control Lists (ACLs).
* [Query String Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html).

These methods can be a little confusing. Take a look at the blog article [IAM Policies and Bucket Policies and ACLs! Oh, My! (Controlling Access to S3 Resources)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/iam-policies-and-bucket-policies-and-acls-oh-my-controlling-access-to-s3-resources/)
