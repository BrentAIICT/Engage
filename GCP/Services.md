# GCP Services Overview

One of the hardest things to learn when starting out with GCP is the array of products offered. This page gives you a summary of the services. Just to get you started.

Under each service summary you will find a `ü§î Think of` point. You may also find a `üåè Scope` or `üó∫Ô∏è Related` or both points. Use these points as a quick reminder of the service function, its scope (Availability Zone, Region, or Global), and related technologies.

For a more complete coverage of the GCP products available, checkout the [Products & Services](https://cloud.google.com/products/) documentation.
