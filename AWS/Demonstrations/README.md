# AWS Demonstrations

* [IAM Role EC2 to S3](/AWS/Demonstrations/iam-role-ec2-to-s3.md)

## Authoring Rules

If you wish to create new demonstrations please name your files following this naming standard:

* All lowercase names.
* Use kebab case (hyphens instead of spaces).
* Use descriptive names.

`[Name of service being demonstrated]-[Name of one or more sub service or feature]-[descriptive name].md`

Example:

`iam-role-ec2-to-s3.md`

For the demonstration content, keep the steps at a high level. Do not go into detail on where to click. Just supply enough detail so anyone with knowledge of AWS can complete the steps. This will keep maintenance to a minimum.

See the [iam-role-ec2-to-s3](iam-role-ec2-to-s3.md) demonstration as an example or template.
